    "First we sat together to clearly discuss our use-case and made a plan how to realize the project. Fortunately we found out that Steve and Paul used quite similar datasets in Homework 2 and that we could combine them perfectly to one use-case scenario. We talked and discussed to formulate a hypothesis we want to investigate. Our communication among the team was really good and therefore we could easily distribute the roles.\n",

    "We could add another dataset which is about the sharing economy in Vienna. For instance, adding a dataset about the parkingspaces, about the public transportation capabilities etc. in Vienna and therefore investigate another hypothesis based on the geo-coordinates of the universities in Vienna. Furthermore we thought about displaying the locations and universities investigated on a map to get a nice overview of the sharing economy in Vienna. \n",
