Hi,

sounds like a very interesting project :)

i used the following code for computing the distance (air line) between two lat/long points
Better estimation - incooperating the distance to the mensa
##Get Mensa coordinates The mensa building is D1 and we get the coordinats from the All main entrances at WU Vienna dataset (http://data.wu.ac.at/dataset/entrances/resource/f92ecfd9-3f0a-4dfd-b6ff-1b0acf0b5340)
In [70]:

mensa_lat=48.21330080810941
mensa_long=16.409165877046618

import math

#from http://www.johndcook.com/blog/python_longitude_latitude/
def distance_on_unit_sphere(lat1, long1, lat2, long2):

   # Convert latitude and longitude to
   # spherical coordinates in radians.
   degrees_to_radians = math.pi/180.0

   # phi = 90 - latitude
   phi1 = (90.0 - lat1)*degrees_to_radians
   phi2 = (90.0 - lat2)*degrees_to_radians

   # theta = longitude
   theta1 = long1*degrees_to_radians
   theta2 = long2*degrees_to_radians

   # Compute spherical distance from spherical coordinates.

   # For two locations in spherical coordinates
   # (1, theta, phi) and (1, theta', phi')
   # cosine( arc length ) =
   #    sin phi sin phi' cos(theta-theta') + cos phi cos phi'
   # distance = rho * arc length

   cos = (math.sin(phi1)*math.sin(phi2)*math.cos(theta1 - theta2) +
          math.cos(phi1)*math.cos(phi2))
   arc = math.acos( cos )

   # Remember to multiply arc by the radius of the earth
   # in your favorite set of units to get length.

   #convert to meters by multiplying it with 6373*1000
   m = arc*6373*1000

   #add additional 100m to cater for walking up and down in buildings
   return (m + 100)

and running it
#distance_on_unit_sphere(48.213301, 16.409166, mensa_lat, mensa_long)

there is also a stack overflow report: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15736995/how-can-i-quickly-estimate-the-distance-between-two-latitude-longitude-points
and a python package which might be helpful
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geopy/1.11.0

i hope this helps, please contact us again if there are any further question or help required.
